What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Though getting used to the whole armlab logistics took time, I really enjoyed 
the dfa and coding part of this assignment. It is also interesting to know that
Java and C has a lot in common. Debugging also took sometime but I was so proud 
of myself when I found the bug and got my code to pass all the test case.
